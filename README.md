## MAC331-Computacional-Geometry

Goals:
Study of algorithms, data structures, and geometric properties used in the resolution of problems of a geometric nature.

Syllabus:
Polygon triangulation: theory, geometric primitives, art gallery problems, algorithms, implementation issues. Polygon partitioning: partitions of monotone polygons, trapezoidal decompositions, partitions in convex polygons. Convex hull in two dimensions: gift wrapping, quickhull, Graham, incremental, divide and conquer algorithms; complexity lower bound. Convex hull in three dimensions: polyhedral, regular polytopes, Euler formula, data structures, geometric primitives, gift wrapping algorithm. Voronoi diagrams: properties, Delaunay diagram, lower bound, geometric primitives, quadratic algorithm, divide and conquer algorithm. Search and intersection: location of point in polygon. Proximity problems: closest pair of points, minimum spanning trees. Arrangements. Tilings in R^d.
